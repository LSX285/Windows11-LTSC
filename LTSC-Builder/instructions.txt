Please make sure that the ISO you try to modify to LTSC includes the Enterprise edition of Windows.
You can obtain an Enterprise/business ISO via the Microsoft website or build your own at https://uupdump.net/

How to run LTSC-Builder.ps1
- Rename the original Windows ISO you downloaded To "Windows" and move it to "C:\"
- Open and right-click run Powershell as Administrator (very important!)
- cd $env:userprofile\Downloads\LTSC-Builder
- .\LTSC-Builder.ps1

If you get an error message that you cannot run scripts, go tod developer settings in Settings and enable "Change execution policy 
to allow local powershell scripts to run without signing."

The process takes about 10-60 minutes depending on your hardware configuration. 
Don't touch your computer during that process.



- Note: You may notice error messages when LTSC Builder tries to remove some Windows Packages.
Thats totally fine and intented behaviour. Please make sure you stay connected to the internet.
